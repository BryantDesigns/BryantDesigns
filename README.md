# Hey there, I'm Tyler üëã

I frequently think back on my unconventional journey from my roots in graphic design to my current role as a software engineer at T-Mobile. It's a journey that shows the value of embracing your passions and the unexpected directions they can take you. Bridging the gap between design and development, I've found a fulfilling niche where I can mentor and lead by example, showing that technical skills and creative vision can coexist and elevate the work we do.
